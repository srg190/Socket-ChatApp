Hi , I'm Sakshi from Indore, India. I've been working as a front-end developer from past 5+ years. 
I've worked as a front-end devloper in various companies. 
From past three years I've been working as a remote front-end developer.
In these 5+ years I've worked on various front-end technologies like HTML, CSS JS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and 
Reactjs, Redux. I've also worked on the 3rd party tools like 
Firebase, Twilio, GraphQL. I also have knowledge of some of the software development tools

From last 1 year I've been working on a project named "say rhino". 
"Say rhino" is a USA-based web app that makes renting a property easy. 
No headaches of security deposit. It allows users to pay for the security deposit on an EMI basis.
My role in this project was to work as a front-end react developer.

integrated APIs, handled client side form validations.
